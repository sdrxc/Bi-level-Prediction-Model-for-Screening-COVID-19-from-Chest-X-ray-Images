##  Abstract

We present a novel **bi-level classification model** for distinguishing between **normal**, **Pneumonia**, and **COVID-19** patients using chest X-ray (CXR) images. Our approach comprises two stages:

1. **Level-1:** Classify subjects as either *Normal* or *Infected (Pneumonia + COVID-19)*.  
2. **Level-2:** Among those predicted as infected, further distinguish between *Pneumonia* and *COVID-19*.

We extract deep features using **VGG19**, then use **shallow learner classifiers** (Logistic Regression, k-NN, CART, Random Forest, XGBoost) for classification. Our balanced dataset of **3,168 CXR images**â€”sourced from repositories like SIRM, COVID-chestxray-dataset, and othersâ€”achieved a remarkable **99.26% accuracy**, outperforming traditional single-level models (96.74% accuracy) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
