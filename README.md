##  Abstract

We present a novel **bi-level classification model** for distinguishing between **Normal**, **Pneumonia**, and **COVID-19** patients using chest X-ray (CXR) images. Our approach consists of:

1. **Level-1:** Classify subjects as *Normal* or *Infected (Pneumonia + COVID-19)*.  
2. **Level-2:** For *Infected* cases, further differentiate between *Pneumonia* and *COVID-19*.

Deep features are extracted using **VGG19**, followed by **shallow learner classifiers** (Logistic Regression, k-NN, CART, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
The model is evaluated on a **balanced dataset of 3,168 CXR images** and achieves **99.26% accuracy**, outperforming single-level classification (96.74% accuracy).
